# BurgerBuilderReactApplication
This project deals with React Application

This is a React Application Project. Technologies used here are React for frontend and Firebase for backend and Database connectivity.

This application gives the flexibility to the user to choose what type of burger ( different quantities of salad, bacon, cheese and meat) the user requires. When the user clicks on submit, an OrderSummary page is shown which informs user about the order and price and when user clicks on Continue, the information is stored in Database (Firebase).
